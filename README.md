## Aproach:

#### Overview:

I started by breaking down the game in 4 different game states. Main game state, combat state, boss combat state and the win state. I then created a list of actions the player can take in the game. With arrows I connected each action to the actor of the different game states and color coded them.

Once the actions and states were paired and broken down. I made the wire frames next to them for each game state. Keeping them color coded.
